# Service Deployment

This repository contains a service that extracts metrics from different data sources and sends them to the Databox platform via Push API. Below are the deployment instructions for deploying the service using Docker or manually.

## Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the following command to build the Docker images and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build

5. Wait for the build process to complete. Once finished, you should see the backend and frontend services running.
6. Access the frontend of the application by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.
7. To stop the containers, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.
